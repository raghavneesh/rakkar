gogeta
======

gegeta is a  web framework to create dynamic HTML in a fastest and easiest way. 
Keep even a small part of your HTML fragment, separate from other and reuse the same HTML fragment with different type of context data, as much as you want.

It compiles the code you write at server itself and create a build for you to be deployed on server.
